## working on Lisp

It's a fresh (not that fresh) start on Lisp.

I'm not sure where is the end, and what is the goal. But I will try to enjoy the process.

My history with Lisp goes back to 2003, when I was working for my master degree. 
When things were not going well, I turned to Lisp for distraction.
It worked, 7 little pieces hold the great power of Lisp.


## Plan

1. 随意地写几篇找找感觉；
2. 感觉好的话，再写几篇；
3. 等写10篇再考虑是不是做一个规划。
