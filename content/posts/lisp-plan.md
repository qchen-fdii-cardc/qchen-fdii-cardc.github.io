## working on Lisp

It's a fresh (not that fresh) start on Lisp.

I'm not sure where is the end, and what is the goal. But I will try to enjoy the process.

My history with Lisp goes back to 2003, when I was working for my master degree. 
When things were not going well, I turned to Lisp for distraction.
It worked, 7 little pieces hold the great power of Lisp.
